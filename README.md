## About
This project consists of the development of an application to manage metered parking on the streets of a specific locality. The project design incorporates various design patterns that helped resolve conflicts during its conception, and it is based on advanced knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## Technologies
After designing the system using key concepts based on OOP, we decided to represent it with a UML diagram. For its implementation and to reinforce the OOP knowledge learned, the team and I decided to implement the idea using Java.

## More
To ensure a correct implementation of the code, we followed an incremental approach using TDD (Test-Driven Development). It has not been connected to any database.
